# University Projects

This is a collection of projects and assignments I did while getting my CS bachelor's degree at the University of Manitoba

## Directory:
- ### Computer Security
    - #### [Encryption and Decryption]()

        A comparison of AES-ECB and AES-CBC encryption modes, and implementation of a key generation algortihm for symmetric encryption/decryption.
    - #### [Buffer Overflow Attack]()

        A writeup about performing a buffer oveflow attack on a program to achive a root shell.
    - #### [Environment Variable Attack]()

        A writeup about modifying a system's `PATH` environment variables to execute arbitrary malicious code.
    - #### [SQL Injection]()

        A basic SQL injection attack on an example website.
    - #### [SYN Flooding Attack]()

        A DOS attack performed using invalid SYN packets to spoof false incoming TCP connections.
- ### Operating Systems
    - #### [ELF File Reader]()

        A custom program designed to read and interpret ELF formatted binary files.
    - #### [Threads and Processes Management]()

        Two programs simulating a handler that manages threads/processes through signals.
    - #### [Custom Shell]()

        A very basic custom shell that can execute other programs and perform basic redirects, piping, and process substitution.
    - #### [EXFAT File Reader]()

        A program that reads any `.exfat` formatted files that are disk images of EXFAT formated file systems.
    - #### [EXFAT Volume Checker]()

        A program that checks EXFAT formated disk images and validates the MBR and file systems consistency.
    - #### [Threads and Locking]()

        An implementation and comparison of various locking techniques used with multithreading.
    - #### [CPU Task Management Simulation]()

        A simulation of a CPU executing and switching between various tasks, organized via a multi-level feedback queue.

- ### Machine Learning
    - #### [K-Step Ahead Forecasting]()

        A custom implementation of an echo state neural network to perform k-step ahead forecasting on `sin` and `lorenz` functions.
- ### Mathematics of Data Science
    A collection of data science projects done in R. The `Code` links take you to the raw .rmd files, and the `Ouptut` links take you to the .rmd knitted together with the cell output in a html file.
    - #### Line of Best Fit
        [Code]() | [Output]()

        Creating a line of best fit to predict future country population, optimizing line hyperparameters through a genetic algorithm and error function.
    - #### Least Squares Problem
        [Code]() | [Output]()

        Implementing Least Squares problem solver, along with some examples of it running.
    - #### Gram-Schmidt and QR Factorization
        [Code]() | [Output]()

        Performing QR Factorization using the Gram-Schmidt process, along with some examples.
    - #### Singular Value Decomposition and Pseudo-Inverse
        [Code]() | [Output]()
    - #### Country Data Analysis
        [Code]() | [Output]()
    - #### Gershgorin Disks
        [Code]() | [Output]()
    - #### Graph Basics
        [Code]() | [Output]()
    - #### Custom Dijkstras Algorithm
        [Code]() | [Output]()
    - #### Graph Analysis with Writeup
        [Code]() | [Output]()
    - #### Markov Chains
        [Code]() | [Output]()
## TODO:
- Comp 3380 project
- Computer graphics stuff
- DB2 query optimization?
- Link to study buddy
- blockchain project?
- research paper python code?
- finish this readme, and add readmes for class folders(?)
