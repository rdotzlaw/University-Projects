### Computer Security
#### [Encryption and Decryption](./Computer%20Security/Encryption%20and%20Decryption/README.md)

A comparison of AES-ECB and AES-CBC encryption modes, and implementation of a key generation algortihm for symmetric encryption/decryption.
#### [Buffer Overflow Attack](./Computer%20Security/Buffer%20Overflow%20Attack/README.md)

A writeup about performing a buffer oveflow attack on a program to achive a root shell.
#### [Environment Variable Attack](./Computer%20Security/Environment%20Variable%20Attack/README.md)

A writeup about modifying a system's `PATH` environment variables to execute arbitrary malicious code.
#### [SQL Injection](./Computer%20Security/SQL%20Injection/README.md)

A basic SQL injection attack on an example website.
#### [SYN Flooding Attack](./Computer%20Security/SYN%20Flooding%20Attack/README.md)

A DOS attack performed using invalid SYN packets to spoof false incoming TCP connections.

### Operating Systems
#### [ELF File Reader](./Operating%20Systems/ELF%20File%20Reader/README.md)

A custom program designed to read and interpret ELF formatted binary files.
#### [Threads and Processes Management](./Operating%20Systems/Threads%20and%20Processes%20Management/README.md)

Two programs simulating a handler that manages threads/processes through signals.
#### [Custom Shell](./Operating%20Systems/Custom%20Shell/README.md)

A very basic custom shell that can execute other programs and perform basic redirects, piping, and process substitution.
#### [EXFAT File Reader](./Operating%20Systems/EXFAT%20File%20Reader/README.md)

A program that reads any `.exfat` formatted files that are disk images of EXFAT formated file systems.
#### [EXFAT Volume Checker](./Operating%20Systems/EXFAT%20Volume%20Checker/README.md)

A program that checks EXFAT formated disk images and validates the MBR and file systems consistency.
#### [Threads and Locking](./Operating%20Systems/Threads%20and%20Locking/README.md)

An implementation and comparison of various locking techniques used with multithreading.
#### [CPU Task Management Simulation](./Operating%20Systems/CPU%20Task%20Management%20Simulation/README.md)

A simulation of a CPU executing and switching between various tasks, organized via a multi-level feedback queue.

### Machine Learning
#### [K-Step Ahead Forecasting](./Machine%20Learning/K-Step%20Ahead%20Forecasting.ipynb)

A custom implementation of an echo state neural network to perform k-step ahead forecasting on `sin` and `lorenz` functions.

### Mathematics of Data Science
A collection of data science projects done in R. The `Code` links take you to the raw .rmd files, and the `Ouptut` links take you to the .rmd knitted together with the cell output in a html file.
#### [Line of Best Fit](./Mathematics%20of%20Data%20Science/Line%20of%20Best%20Fit.Rmd)

Creating a line of best fit to predict future country population, optimizing line hyperparameters through a genetic algorithm and error function.

#### [Least Squares Problem](./Mathematics%20of%20Data%20Science/Least%20Squares%20Problem.Rmd)

Implementing Least Squares problem solver, along with some examples of it running.

#### [Gram-Schmidt and QR Factorization](./Mathematics%20of%20Data%20Science/Gram-Schmidt%20and%20QR%20Factorization.Rmd)

Performing QR Factorization using the Gram-Schmidt process, along with some examples.
#### [Singular Value Decomposition and Pseudo-Inverse](./Mathematics%20of%20Data%20Science/Singular%20Value%20Decomposition%20and%20Pseudo-Inverse.Rmd)

#### [Country Data Analysis]()

Performing preliminary data cleaning along with a mathematical analysis on country data.

#### [Gershgorin Disks]()

Implement functions to calculate Greshgorin Disks and plot them on a cartesian plane.

#### [Graph Basics]()

Some very simple graph functions just to re-familarize myself with basic graphs.

#### [Custom Dijkstras Algorithm]()

An implementation of Dijkstras path finding algorithm.

#### [Graph Analysis with Writeup]()

A mathematical and visual analysis of a graph representing the relationships between members of a university faculty.

#### [Markov Chains]()

Custom markov chain functions along with computing absorbing states and graph regularity.

---

### Computer Graphics

#### [Lines, Triangles, and Surface Tesselation]()

Using only the built in method for setting an individual pixel to a color I implemented:
- Bresenham's Line algorithm to draw a line from one pixel to another.
- Used Bresenham's Line algorithm to draw a 2D triangle projection of a rotating triangle in 3D space.
- Used 2D triangle projections to tesselate the surface of a 3D rotating sphere.
- Implemented several lighting models for triangles to shade the sphere.

The following are controls used when running the code:
- O: toggles outlines.
- Space: toggles rotation.
- D and E: next and previous display respectively.
- S and W: next and previous shading mode respectively.

#### [Raytracer]()

## TODO:
Comp 3380 project

Computer graphics stuff

DB2 query optimization?

Link to study buddy

blockchain project?

research paper python code?

finish this readme, and add readmes for class folders(?)
