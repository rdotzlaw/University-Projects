# University Projects

This is a collection of projects and assignments I did while getting my CS bachelor's degree at the University of Manitoba

## Directory:
### Computer Security
#### [Encryption and Decryption](./Computer%20Security/Encryption%20and%20Decryption/README.md)

    A comparison of AES-ECB and AES-CBC encryption modes, and implementation of a key generation algortihm for symmetric encryption/decryption.
#### [Buffer Overflow Attack](./Computer%20Security/Buffer%20Overflow%20Attack/README.md)

    A writeup about performing a buffer oveflow attack on a program to achive a root shell.
#### [Environment Variable Attack](./Computer%20Security/Environment%20Variable%20Attack/README.md)

    A writeup about modifying a system's `PATH` environment variables to execute arbitrary malicious code.
#### [SQL Injection](./Computer%20Security/SQL%20Injection/README.md)

    A basic SQL injection attack on an example website.
#### [SYN Flooding Attack](./Computer%20Security/SYN%20Flooding%20Attack/README.md)

    A DOS attack performed using invalid SYN packets to spoof false incoming TCP connections.
### Operating Systems
#### [ELF File Reader](./Operating%20Systems/ELF%20File%20Reader/README.md)

    A custom program designed to read and interpret ELF formatted binary files.
#### [Threads and Processes Management](./Operating%20Systems/Threads%20and%20Processes%20Management/README.md)

    Two programs simulating a handler that manages threads/processes through signals.
#### [Custom Shell](./Operating%20Systems/Custom%20Shell/README.md)

    A very basic custom shell that can execute other programs and perform basic redirects, piping, and process substitution.
#### [EXFAT File Reader](./Operating%20Systems/EXFAT%20File%20Reader/README.md)

    A program that reads any `.exfat` formatted files that are disk images of EXFAT formated file systems.
#### [EXFAT Volume Checker](./Operating%20Systems/EXFAT%20Volume%20Checker/README.md)

    A program that checks EXFAT formated disk images and validates the MBR and file systems consistency.
#### [Threads and Locking](./Operating%20Systems/Threads%20and%20Locking/README.md)

    An implementation and comparison of various locking techniques used with multithreading.
#### [CPU Task Management Simulation](./Operating%20Systems/CPU%20Task%20Management%20Simulation/README.md)

    A simulation of a CPU executing and switching between various tasks, organized via a multi-level feedback queue.

### Machine Learning
#### [K-Step Ahead Forecasting](./Machine%20Learning/K-Step%20Ahead%20Forecasting.ipynb)

    A custom implementation of an echo state neural network to perform k-step ahead forecasting on `sin` and `lorenz` functions.
### Mathematics of Data Science
A collection of data science projects done in R. The `Code` links take you to the raw .rmd files, and the `Ouptut` links take you to the .rmd knitted together with the cell output in a html file.
#### Line of Best Fit
[Code](./Mathematics%20of%20Data%20Science/Line%20of%20Best%20Fit.Rmd) | [Output]()

    Creating a line of best fit to predict future country population, optimizing line hyperparameters through a genetic algorithm and error function.
#### Least Squares Problem
[Code](./Mathematics%20of%20Data%20Science/Least%20Squares%20Problem.Rmd) | [Output]()

    Implementing Least Squares problem solver, along with some examples of it running.
#### Gram-Schmidt and QR Factorization
[Code](./Mathematics%20of%20Data%20Science/Gram-Schmidt%20and%20QR%20Factorization.Rmd) | [Output]()

    Performing QR Factorization using the Gram-Schmidt process, along with some examples.
#### Singular Value Decomposition and Pseudo-Inverse
[Code](./Mathematics%20of%20Data%20Science/Singular%20Value%20Decomposition%20and%20Pseudo-Inverse.Rmd) | [Output]()
#### Country Data Analysis
[Code]() | [Output]()
#### Gershgorin Disks
[Code]() | [Output]()
#### Graph Basics
[Code]() | [Output]()
#### Custom Dijkstras Algorithm
[Code]() | [Output]()
#### Graph Analysis with Writeup
[Code]() | [Output]()
#### Markov Chains
[Code]() | [Output]()
## TODO:
Comp 3380 project

Computer graphics stuff

DB2 query optimization?

Link to study buddy

blockchain project?

research paper python code?

finish this readme, and add readmes for class folders(?)
