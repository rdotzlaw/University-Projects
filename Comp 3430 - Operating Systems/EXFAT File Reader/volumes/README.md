COMP3430 A4 exFAT volumes
=========================

Included in this package are two exFAT formatted volumes that you can use to
test your file system reader, a `README.md` (what you're reading right now!),
and a file called `tree.txt`.

Volumes
-------

The two volumes in this package contain *exactly* the same set of files (see
`tree.txt`), but they differ in two ways: their volume label and the number of
sectors per cluster. Both of these volumes are 64MB volumes.

The volume in `1sector-per-cluster/a4image.exfat` has been formatted with the
volume label "COMP34301S". This volume has been formatted so that clusters in
the data heap are 1 sector in size. There are 35475 kilobytes free on this
volume.

The volume in `4sectors-per-cluster/a4image.exfat` has been formatted with the
volume label "COMP34304S". This volume has been formatted so that clusters in
the data heap are 4 sectors in size. There are 34344 kilobytes free on this
volume.

`tree.txt`
----------

The file `tree.txt` is a listing of all the files contained within the volume.
The file was generated by running

```bash
tree > tree.txt
```

from the root directory of the volume.
